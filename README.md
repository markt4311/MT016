EPM7128S shift register SPI micro SD Card interface for RC2014.

THIS IS AN UNTESTED DESIGN

This pcb design is a variant of the shift register SPI micro SD card interface using an EPM7128S CPLD instead of discrete logic. The operation is identical to the discrete logic version.

The 2x39 bus connector is based on the RC2014 Enhanced bus connector pinout and intended to be compatible with backplanes using the 2x40 female header sockets.

Board outline is not standard RC2014, 100mm x 25mm and 2x39 straight pin header is edge mounted instead of using a right angled pin header.
